## About This Practice

It was maybe the 2019/2020 when I started web design. I was maybe the happiest person at that time while I was viewing my output from index.html. So, I thought this noob practice file will be motivating me in my whole development life. Something advanced I tried to show here also that might be helpful-

- [Some advanced tags and attributes maybe you never used]
- [HTML Optimization]
- [How HTML Knows How to SEO that maybe you don't know]
- [All Tags and Attributes].
